      During the R&D phase of engineering, it became clear to us that the Borescope industry was lacking a product with high-end technology at a reasonable price. Today, <strong>SPI Borescopes</strong> has solved this issue by producing high-end Borescopes and Articulating Video Borescopes with a fair price tag. No longer does the industry force the consumer to choose between great technology at extremely high prices or poor technology for very low prices; now there is a better option. Through this process our Borescopes have helped companies improve their inspection processes worldwide.  Whether you need Articulation, Side-View Attachments, Flexible, Rigid, or even a Heatproof Scope, <strong>SPI</strong> has the right scope at the right price for you.</p>
